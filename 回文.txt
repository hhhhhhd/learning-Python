# You can read a string backwards with the following syntax:
# string[::-1] - where the "-1" means one step back.
# This exercise can be solved with only unit 1 knowledge
# (no loops or conditions)

word = "madam"
# test case 2
# word = "madman" # uncomment this to test

is_palindrome = word[::-1]

# TESTING
print is_palindrome
# >>> 0  # outcome if word == "madam"
# >>> -1 # outcome if word == "madman"
